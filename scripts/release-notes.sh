# Prints the release notes of one version from RELEASE.md: the lines after
# the heading "## <tag>" up to the next line that is exactly "---". This is
# the format of every otfabric repository, and the rule the shared Go
# release workflow (otfabric/.github, go-package-release.yml) applies.
#
# Usage: release-notes.sh [<tag>]     e.g. release-notes.sh v0.1.5
#        Without a tag: the newest version, the first "## vX.Y.Z" heading.
#
# Fails when RELEASE.md has no such section, when the section is empty or
# when it does not end with "---": the release workflow publishes exactly
# this text as the body of the GitHub release.
